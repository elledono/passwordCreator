# Password Creator
Randomly generate passwords that are more secure

## Description

This simple little console app allows you to quickly generate up to ten passwords at a time
of a specified length. It could be useful in creating a more secure password that is not 
as easily guessed as a password that contained actual phrases. It will give you a mix of
symbols, numbers, upper and lowercase letters.
***This code is for educational purposes so use for actual real-world applications at your own risk.***
